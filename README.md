##As part of my 6-week frontend web development internship at Codetech, I built a fully functional Quiz Application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project was assigned to help us practice real-world development skills with key frontend technologies. The goal was to create an interactive quiz platform where users could answer multiple-choice questions and see immediately if their answer was correct. We also needed to provide explanations for each answer, randomize the questions, and track the final score at the end of the quiz.

I used Visual Studio Code as my main code editor because it is lightweight, user-friendly, and offers helpful extensions for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I handled the UI part with HTML and CSS. I structured the page elements first and then styled them to look clean and modern. I aimed for a neat appearance without being too plain, so I added subtle dotted background patterns and a soft color scheme for visual interest. The layout is also responsive, ensuring it works well on both desktop and mobile screens.

The real challenge, and fun, came with JavaScript. I created around 10 quiz questions, each with four options, and used JavaScript to shuffle them randomly and display them one at a time. When a user selects an option, the app checks if it is correct, shows a brief explanation, and moves to the next question. The score is calculated automatically and displayed at the end with a simple message. Everything is dynamic; there is no need to refresh or reload the page at any point. I accomplished this with basic JavaScript logic, without any frameworks or libraries, which helped me understand the core concepts better.

I focused on making sure the code was clean and easy to understand. I also used Git and GitHub to keep track of my work, and I am now hosting the project on my GitHub profile as a portfolio piece. It is a simple project, but it significantly improved my skills in writing reusable code, handling user interactions, and designing a smooth user experience. I also gained more confidence using developer tools for testing and debugging.

Overall, I am pleased with how the project turned out. It looks polished, works smoothly, and provided me with hands-on experience in applying everything Iâ€™ve learned so far. This has been a valuable learning opportunity, and I look forward to creating more real-world projects like this during the rest of my internship.
